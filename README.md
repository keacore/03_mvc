# #3 MVC 
## _Model, View, Controller_

Today we will work with MVC, or the _Model, View, Controller_ Pattern.
This will also include learning about Routing.

Until now we have more less hardcoded everything we have done, but in the end of today, we will take it a step further and start using more anvanced genrators. 
This means that more code will be genrated for us, and make the development process faster.
